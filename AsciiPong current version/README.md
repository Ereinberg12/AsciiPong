# AsciiPong

Hi, I'm a student at USC studying computer science and business. I made this game for fun in my free time. It was created entirely using C++ with no external libraries outside of the C++ stl, which is why the graphs are ASCII.

Instructions For Running: 

-Use the Makefile to create an executible by typing "make" (no quotes) in the terminal. The game only works on Mac and Linux. Sorry Windows People.

Change Log:

-1.13: Added the intro screen and fixed a memory management bug, so the width of the screen no longer breaks for widths > 287 characters. Reformatted the files into folders.

-1.12: Added Pause and Quit Button. Imporoved file management. 

-1.11: Added end screen and bug fixes.

-1.10: Bug fixes.

-1.9: Bug fixes.

-1.8: Made game resizeable (the first public release version of the game).
